# Joel Hansen Blog Project

## Description
- This project is an example of a multi-page blog web application where users can enter information(their username, a title for their post, and content of their post) which will be posted on the second page of the blog.  There is also a lightbulb icon that can be clicked to change the color from default(dark mode) to light mode.  There is back button on the blog page that allows the user to return to the landing page and post another blog entry.  Additionally; there is a link at the bottom titled 'Portfolio' that will link the user to a new web page for my professional portfolio.
